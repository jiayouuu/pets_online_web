# Frontend Development Guidelines for Vue3, Setup Syntax, and Vuetify

# Language and Syntax
- Utilize TypeScript across all development sectors for type safety and improved maintainability.
- Leverage Vue 3's setup syntax to organize component logic intuitively.
- Prefer arrow functions for cleaner and more concise code wherever applicable.
- Implement async/await for managing asynchronous processes to enhance readability and error handling.

# Components Naming and Structure
- Use kebab-case for naming Vue component files and directories (e.g., `example-component.vue`).
- Adhere to PascalCase inside templates for component names.

# Styling with SCSS
- Keep SCSS simple and efficient; use variables and mixins to abstract repeated styles.
- Ensure styles are scoped to components to prevent CSS conflict and leakage.
- Emphasize modular SCSS to streamline and manage complex styling efficiently.

# Libraries and Frameworks
- Use Vuetify for UI elements to capitalize on a consistent design framework.
- Follow Vuetify's guidelines to ensure alignment with its component structure and theme management.

# Documentation and Comments
- Write necessary inline and block comments to clarify component logic and any complex asynchronous processes.
- Employ JSDoc annotations to document functions and complex code segments thoroughly.

# Image Placeholders
- When using placeholder images, use links to freely-available images from resources such as Unsplash or Pexels.

# Performance Optimization
- Import only the required Vuetify components to minimize application load and improve performance.
- Utilize lazy loading for route and component importation to optimize initial loading times.

# Advanced Practices
- Maintain a clean and consistent coding style using linters like ESLint for automated issue detection.
- Implement comprehensive error-handling practices using try-catch blocks for async operations.

# Miscellaneous
- Utilize modern JavaScript practices to optimize and ensure consistency across the codebase.
